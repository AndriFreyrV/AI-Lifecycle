       "      <td>A leading bank regulator on Friday reversed course and revoked Wells Fargo’s right to shield the pay of former executives after a   scandal. The regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, also said Wells Fargo must now seek advance approval before naming new bank leadership. Wells Fargo in September agreed to pay $185 million to settle charges that bank employees opened as many as two million accounts banking and credit card without customers’ knowledge. The agency, the main regulator for federal banks, exempted Wells Fargo from some controls on “golden parachutes” in that settlement. The move Friday evening voids those earlier allowances, the agency said. The bank was notified on Friday that the agency had revoked “relief from specific requirements and limitations regarding rules, policies, and procedures for corporate activities,” the comptroller’s office said in a statement on Friday. An official of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said the move put Wells Fargo under toughened standards for oversight which the agency had exempted in the original settlement. John G. Stumpf, Wells Fargo’s former  chief executive, and Carrie Tolstedt, former head of retail banking, have relinquished about $60 million in stock after the scandal, according to a Reuters review of securities filings. But the pair also stood to take home more than $350 million in compensation, according to filings.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON  —     has agreed to pay a $12 million civil fine and stop selling illegal aftermarket devices that cause its motorcycles to emit too much pollution, the Justice Department said on Thursday. The settlement resolves government accusations that Harley sold roughly 340, 000 “super tuners,” enabling motorcycles since 2008 to pollute the air at levels greater than what the company certified to the Environmental Protection Agency. Harley did not admit liability, and said in a statement that it disagreed with the government’s position, arguing that the devices were designed and sold to be used in “competition only. ” The company said the settlement represented “a   compromise with the E. P. A. on areas of law we interpret differently, particularly E. P. A. ’s assertion that it is illegal for anyone to modify a certified vehicle even if it will be used solely for     competition. ” According to the government, the sale of such   defeat devices violated the federal Clean Air Act. Harley was also accused of selling more than 12, 600 motorcycles that were not covered by an E. P. A. certification governing clean air compliance. The announcement comes at a time of greater scrutiny on emissions and defeat devices by regulators in Washington after Volkswagen admitted using illegal software to evade emissions standards in nearly 600, 000 vehicles in the United States. The settlement calls for   to stop selling the super tuners by Tuesday, and to buy back and destroy all such tuners in stock at its dealerships. The E. P. A. said the modified settings increased power and performance, but also increased the motorcycles’ emissions of hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides. Harley, based in Milwaukee, will also spend $3 million on an unrelated project to reduce air pollution, the Justice Department said.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Pope Francis said on Sunday that Christians and the Roman Catholic Church should seek forgiveness from gays for the way they had treated them. Speaking to reporters aboard a plane taking him back to Rome from Armenia, the pope also said the church should ask forgiveness for the way it has treated women, for turning a blind eye to child labor and for “blessing so many weapons” in the past. In an hourlong freewheeling conversation that has become a trademark of his international travels, Francis was asked by a reporter if he agreed with recent comments by a Roman Catholic cardinal from Germany that the church should apologize to gays and if an apology was made more urgent by the killing of 49 people at a gay club in Florida this month. Francis, looking sad, recalled church teachings that homosexuals “should not be discriminated against. ” “They should be respected, accompanied pastorally,” he said. Then he added that he thought the church should apologize not only to gay people it had offended, but also to the poor, to women who have been exploited, and to children who have been exploited by being forced to work. “It must apologize for having blessed so many weapons,” Francis added. The church teaches that gay tendencies are not sinful but that gay acts are, and that gays should try to be chaste. The pope repeated a slightly modified version of the   “Who am I to judge?” comment he made about gays on the first foreign trip after his election in 2013. “The questions is: If a person who has that condition, who has good will, and who looks for God, who are we to judge?” he said. A Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, said that the pope’s reference to “that condition” referred not to a medical condition but to “a person in that situation. ” In Italian, the word condition can also mean situation. “We Christians have to apologize for so many things, not just for this (treatment of gays) but we must ask for forgiveness, not just apologize. Forgiveness  —   Lord, it is a word we forget so often,” he said. Francis has been hailed by many gay people for being the most merciful pope toward them in recent history, and conservative Catholics have criticized him for making comments that they say are ambiguous about sexual morality. He told reporters on the plane that “there are traditions in some countries, some cultures, that have a different mentality about this question (gays)” and that there were “some (gay) demonstrations that are too offensive for some. ” But he suggested that those were not grounds for discrimination or marginalization of gays. The pope did not elaborate on what he meant by seeking forgiveness for the church “having blessed so many weapons,” but it appeared to be a reference to some Catholics who have actively backed wars in the past. In other parts of the conversation, Francis said he hoped the European Union would be able to give itself another form after Britain’s vote to leave. “Let’s not throw the baby out with the bath water,” he said. “Let’s try to   things, to  . ”</td>\n",

(Reuters) – Democrat Hillary Clinton’s top aides on Saturday lashed out at FBI Director James Comey for igniting a new controversy over a long-running private email investigation less than two weeks before the presidential election, saying there was no evidence of wrongdoing and accusing him of spreading “innuendo.” \\nComey, who has headed the Federal Bureau of Investigation since 2013, notified the U.S. Congress on Friday that the agency is again reviewing emails, even though in July it decided not to seek prosecution of Clinton for her handling of classified materials on a private email server while she was secretary of state. \\nJohn Podesta, who heads Clinton’s presidential campaign, told reporters that Comey’s letter to Congress was “light on facts, heavy on innuendo,” and he urged Comey to “come forward and give those answers to the American public” about the exact nature of the FBI’s latest review of emails. \\nSources close to the investigation on Friday said the latest emails were discovered as part of a separate probe into Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin. \\nWeiner, a former U.S. congressman from New York, is the target of an FBI investigation into illicit text messages he is alleged to have sent to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina. \\nWith the Nov. 8 elections quickly approaching, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump pounded away at the new FBI development, devoting a large part of a campaign speech in Golden, Colorado, to attacking Clinton and arguing that she is not to be trusted with the presidency. \\n“Her criminal action was willful, deliberate, intentional and purposeful,” Trump said, standing in front of hay bales stacked in a horse barn. “Hillary set up an illegal server for the obvious purpose of shielding her illegal actions from public disclosure and exposure.” \\nComey, however, has not provided any details on whether the emails now under review are being seen for the first time by the FBI or the nature of their contents. \\nClinton’s campaign tried to play down the new review. “There’s no evidence of wrongdoing, no charge of wrongdoing,” Podesta said, in the FBI’s latest announcement that it was taking “appropriate investigative steps” after learning of emails “that appear to be pertinent” to the earlier probe. \\nClinton campaign manager Robby Mook, trying to tamp down speculation of a voter backlash this late in the campaign, said Americans had already “factored” what they knew about the email investigation into how they would cast their ballots. \\n“We don’t see it changing the landscape” for undecided voters, Mook said. \\nClinton aides also said this latest controversy has further energized her supporters. \\nClinton was campaigning in Florida on Saturday, a battleground state that many analysts say Trump must win in order to have any chance of being elected. \\nIn recent weeks, Trump has been running behind Clinton in most public opinion polls. \\nJustice Department officials, according to a source who asked not to be identified, were opposed to the FBI director’s letter being sent to Congress and believe his actions conflict with a Justice Department memo outlining instructions that agencies should not to act in ways that could influence elections. \\nWhile Attorney General Loretta Lynch did not discuss the matter directly with Comey, the source said aides were in touch with each other. \\nComey let it be known he felt he had to send the letter as a follow-up to his congressional testimony earlier this year regarding the FBI’s probe of Clinton’s emails, the source said. \\nMeanwhile, Clinton supporters rallied to her defense following Friday’s FBI disclosure. \\nThe Congressional Black Caucus, comprised of about 45 members of the House of Representatives, nearly all Democrats, held a news conference in Columbus, Ohio, and urged Comey to release more details. \\n(Reporting by Steve Holland in Golden, Colorado, ans Roberta Rampton in Daytona Beach, Florida; Additional reporting by Mark Hosenball in Washington; Writing by Richard Cowan; Editing by James Dalgleish and Leslie Adlerand Leslie Adler) \\nClinton campaign urges FBI to detail new developments in email case added by Reuters on Sat, Oct 29th, 2016</td>\n",

       "      <td>Reuters</td>\n",
       "      <td>The nation’s consumer watchdog agency on Tuesday ordered the   agencies TransUnion and Equifax to pay more than $23. 2 million in fines and restitution for deceiving customers about the usefulness of credit scores and the cost of obtaining them. The watchdog agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, said the payments would resolve charges that TransUnion and Equifax had lured consumers into enrolling in credit services advertised as free or costing only $1, but which could cost more than $200 a year. TransUnion will reimburse $13. 93 million to consumers and pay a $3 million civil fine, while Equifax will reimburse $3. 8 million and pay a $2. 5 million civil fine, the bureau said. Both companies will also modify their marketing practices. Among the changes, they will obtain customers’ consent to enroll them in services in which fees begin after free trials and make it easier for them to cancel services they do not want. The bureau said the wrongful conduct had violated the     law and had occurred at TransUnion since July 2011 and at Equifax between July 2011 and March 2014. Many lenders rely on credit scores from TransUnion, Equifax and their rival Experian when lending money. But TransUnion and Equifax falsely represented the credit scores they sold to consumers as being the same scores that lenders used, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said. “Credit scores are central to a consumer’s financial life, and people deserve honest and accurate information about them,” Richard Cordray, the bureau’s director, said in a statement. Neither TransUnion, which is based in Chicago, nor Equifax, which is based in Atlanta, admitted or denied wrongdoing. A TransUnion spokesman, David Blumberg, and an Equifax spokeswoman, Ines Gutzmer, said their companies believed that they had complied with the law and were committed to better educating consumers about their credit. Experian was not charged. A spokesman for the bureau did not immediately have additional comment. In 2015, under a separate settlement with 31 state attorneys general, the   agencies agreed to improve how they fixed mistakes and addressed disputes.</td>\n",

       "      <td>By Reuters   7:16 pm Heading into the homestretch of the presidential campaign, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton is looking to harness some celebrity star power to help get out the vote and energize volunteers in battleground states.   \\nBy Roberta Rampton \\nDAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (Reuters) – Heading into the homestretch of the presidential campaign, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton is looking to harness some celebrity star power to help get out the vote and energize volunteers in battleground states. \\nJennifer Lopez will headline a free concert for Clinton supporters in Miami on Saturday, giving the former secretary of state a chance to connect with the key demographic of millennials she has sometimes struggled to reach – and some visual counter-programming to the latest email controversy to roil her race for the White House. \\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation said on Friday it is investigating more emails as part of a probe into Clinton’s use of a private email system – a late-breaking surprise that will likely continue to get extensive media play leading up to the Nov. 8 vote \\nCelebrity-driven events like the concert “can serve as a bit of a distraction” from the controversy, said Eric Kasper, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire. \\n“It is a way to kind of take the edge off things because it tends to be more positive,” Kasper said. \\nThe JLo concert is the first in a series. Next week, Clinton will take the stage with Jay Z in Cleveland, and then with Katy Perry in Philadelphia on Nov. 5. \\nA Harvard University poll this week showed that among likely voters aged 18 to 29, Clinton is leading Republican rival Donald Trump, a celebrity in his own right who starred in the reality television show “The Apprentice.” \\nBut turnout is a concern. The exceptionally negative tone of this year’s race for the White House has soured young Americans on politics, Reuters/Ipsos polling shows. \\nPresidential candidates have long sought to create buzz with help from celebrity pals, said Tevi Troy, who chronicled the strategy in his book “What Jefferson Read, Ike Watched, and Obama Tweeted: 200 Years of Pop Culture in the White House.” \\n“Campaigns do it to reach out to people who are not necessarily interested in politics but are interested in pop culture,” said Troy, a presidential historian who worked in the George W. Bush White House. \\nThe events are like a larger version of a campaign yard sign, a way to show a “groundswell” of support behind a candidate – and a way to appeal to fans of the musicians, said Kasper, who has studied the intersection between pop culture and politics. \\n“It can create a kind of psychological connection that we otherwise might not have when a politician endorses a presidential candidate, for instance,” Kasper said. \\n(Reporting by Roberta Rampton; Editing by Leslie Adler) \\nConcert plus campaign: Clinton turns to celebrities in homestretch added by Reuters on Sat, Oct 29th, 2016</td>\n",

The regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, also said Wells Fargo must now seek advance approval before naming new bank leadership. Wells Fargo in September agreed to pay $185 million to settle charges that bank employees opened as many as two million accounts banking and credit card without customers’ knowledge. The agency, the main regulator for federal banks, exempted Wells Fargo from some controls on “golden parachutes” in that settlement. The move Friday evening voids those earlier allowances, the agency said. The bank was notified on Friday that the agency had revoked “relief from specific requirements and limitations regarding rules, policies, and procedures for corporate activities,” the comptroller’s office said in a statement on Friday. An official of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said the move put Wells Fargo under toughened standards for oversight which the agency had exempted in the original settlement. John G. Stumpf, Wells Fargo’s former  chief executive, and Carrie Tolstedt, former head of retail banking, have relinquished about $60 million in stock after the scandal, according to a Reuters review of securities filings. But the pair also stood to take home more than $350 million in compensation, according to filings.   \n",

The settlement resolves government accusations that Harley sold roughly 340, 000 “super tuners,” enabling motorcycles since 2008 to pollute the air at levels greater than what the company certified to the Environmental Protection Agency. Harley did not admit liability, and said in a statement that it disagreed with the government’s position, arguing that the devices were designed and sold to be used in “competition only. ” The company said the settlement represented “a   compromise with the E. P. A. on areas of law we interpret differently, particularly E. P. A. ’s assertion that it is illegal for anyone to modify a certified vehicle even if it will be used solely for     competition. ” According to the government, the sale of such   defeat devices violated the federal Clean Air Act. Harley was also accused of selling more than 12, 600 motorcycles that were not covered by an E. P. A. certification governing clean air compliance. The announcement comes at a time of greater scrutiny on emissions and defeat devices by regulators in Washington after Volkswagen admitted using illegal software to evade emissions standards in nearly 600, 000 vehicles in the United States. The settlement calls for   to stop selling the super tuners by Tuesday, and to buy back and destroy all such tuners in stock at its dealerships. The E. P. A. said the modified settings increased power and performance, but also increased the motorcycles’ emissions of hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides. Harley, based in Milwaukee, will also spend $3 million on an unrelated project to reduce air pollution, the Justice Department said.   \n",

Speaking to reporters aboard a plane taking him back to Rome from Armenia, the pope also said the church should ask forgiveness for the way it has treated women, for turning a blind eye to child labor and for “blessing so many weapons” in the past. In an hourlong freewheeling conversation that has become a trademark of his international travels, Francis was asked by a reporter if he agreed with recent comments by a Roman Catholic cardinal from Germany that the church should apologize to gays and if an apology was made more urgent by the killing of 49 people at a gay club in Florida this month. Francis, looking sad, recalled church teachings that homosexuals “should not be discriminated against. ” “They should be respected, accompanied pastorally,” he said. Then he added that he thought the church should apologize not only to gay people it had offended, but also to the poor, to women who have been exploited, and to children who have been exploited by being forced to work. “It must apologize for having blessed so many weapons,” Francis added. The church teaches that gay tendencies are not sinful but that gay acts are, and that gays should try to be chaste. The pope repeated a slightly modified version of the   “Who am I to judge?” comment he made about gays on the first foreign trip after his election in 2013. “The questions is: If a person who has that condition, who has good will, and who looks for God, who are we to judge?” he said. A Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, said that the pope’s reference to “that condition” referred not to a medical condition but to “a person in that situation. ” In Italian, the word condition can also mean situation. “We Christians have to apologize for so many things, not just for this (treatment of gays) but we must ask for forgiveness, not just apologize. Forgiveness  —   Lord, it is a word we forget so often,” he said. Francis has been hailed by many gay people for being the most merciful pope toward them in recent history, and conservative Catholics have criticized him for making comments that they say are ambiguous about sexual morality. He told reporters on the plane that “there are traditions in some countries, some cultures, that have a different mentality about this question (gays)” and that there were “some (gay) demonstrations that are too offensive for some. ” But he suggested that those were not grounds for discrimination or marginalization of gays. The pope did not elaborate on what he meant by seeking forgiveness for the church “having blessed so many weapons,” but it appeared to be a reference to some Catholics who have actively backed wars in the past. In other parts of the conversation, Francis said he hoped the European Union would be able to give itself another form after Britain’s vote to leave. “Let’s not throw the baby out with the bath water,” he said. “Let’s try to   things, to  . ”   \n",

(Reuters) – Democrat Hillary Clinton’s top aides on Saturday lashed out at FBI Director James Comey for igniting a new controversy over a long-running private email investigation less than two weeks before the presidential election, saying there was no evidence of wrongdoing and accusing him of spreading “innuendo.” \\nComey, who has headed the Federal Bureau of Investigation since 2013, notified the U.S. Congress on Friday that the agency is again reviewing emails, even though in July it decided not to seek prosecution of Clinton for her handling of classified materials on a private email server while she was secretary of state. \\nJohn Podesta, who heads Clinton’s presidential campaign, told reporters that Comey’s letter to Congress was “light on facts, heavy on innuendo,” and he urged Comey to “come forward and give those answers to the American public” about the exact nature of the FBI’s latest review of emails. \\nSources close to the investigation on Friday said the latest emails were discovered as part of a separate probe into Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin. \\nWeiner, a former U.S. congressman from New York, is the target of an FBI investigation into illicit text messages he is alleged to have sent to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina. \\nWith the Nov. 8 elections quickly approaching, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump pounded away at the new FBI development, devoting a large part of a campaign speech in Golden, Colorado, to attacking Clinton and arguing that she is not to be trusted with the presidency. \\n“Her criminal action was willful, deliberate, intentional and purposeful,” Trump said, standing in front of hay bales stacked in a horse barn. “Hillary set up an illegal server for the obvious purpose of shielding her illegal actions from public disclosure and exposure.” \\nComey, however, has not provided any details on whether the emails now under review are being seen for the first time by the FBI or the nature of their contents. \\nClinton’s campaign tried to play down the new review. “There’s no evidence of wrongdoing, no charge of wrongdoing,” Podesta said, in the FBI’s latest announcement that it was taking “appropriate investigative steps” after learning of emails “that appear to be pertinent” to the earlier probe. \\nClinton campaign manager Robby Mook, trying to tamp down speculation of a voter backlash this late in the campaign, said Americans had already “factored” what they knew about the email investigation into how they would cast their ballots. \\n“We don’t see it changing the landscape” for undecided voters, Mook said. \\nClinton aides also said this latest controversy has further energized her supporters. \\nClinton was campaigning in Florida on Saturday, a battleground state that many analysts say Trump must win in order to have any chance of being elected. \\nIn recent weeks, Trump has been running behind Clinton in most public opinion polls. \\nJustice Department officials, according to a source who asked not to be identified, were opposed to the FBI director’s letter being sent to Congress and believe his actions conflict with a Justice Department memo outlining instructions that agencies should not to act in ways that could influence elections. \\nWhile Attorney General Loretta Lynch did not discuss the matter directly with Comey, the source said aides were in touch with each other. \\nComey let it be known he felt he had to send the letter as a follow-up to his congressional testimony earlier this year regarding the FBI’s probe of Clinton’s emails, the source said. \\nMeanwhile, Clinton supporters rallied to her defense following Friday’s FBI disclosure. \\nThe Congressional Black Caucus, comprised of about 45 members of the House of Representatives, nearly all Democrats, held a news conference in Columbus, Ohio, and urged Comey to release more details. \\n(Reporting by Steve Holland in Golden, Colorado, ans Roberta Rampton in Daytona Beach, Florida; Additional reporting by Mark Hosenball in Washington; Writing by Richard Cowan; Editing by James Dalgleish and Leslie Adlerand Leslie Adler) \\nClinton campaign urges FBI to detail new developments in email case added by Reuters on Sat, Oct 29th, 2016   \n",

The watchdog agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, said the payments would resolve charges that TransUnion and Equifax had lured consumers into enrolling in credit services advertised as free or costing only $1, but which could cost more than $200 a year. TransUnion will reimburse $13. 93 million to consumers and pay a $3 million civil fine, while Equifax will reimburse $3. 8 million and pay a $2. 5 million civil fine, the bureau said. Both companies will also modify their marketing practices. Among the changes, they will obtain customers’ consent to enroll them in services in which fees begin after free trials and make it easier for them to cancel services they do not want. The bureau said the wrongful conduct had violated the     law and had occurred at TransUnion since July 2011 and at Equifax between July 2011 and March 2014. Many lenders rely on credit scores from TransUnion, Equifax and their rival Experian when lending money. But TransUnion and Equifax falsely represented the credit scores they sold to consumers as being the same scores that lenders used, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said. “Credit scores are central to a consumer’s financial life, and people deserve honest and accurate information about them,” Richard Cordray, the bureau’s director, said in a statement. Neither TransUnion, which is based in Chicago, nor Equifax, which is based in Atlanta, admitted or denied wrongdoing. A TransUnion spokesman, David Blumberg, and an Equifax spokeswoman, Ines Gutzmer, said their companies believed that they had complied with the law and were committed to better educating consumers about their credit. Experian was not charged. A spokesman for the bureau did not immediately have additional comment. In 2015, under a separate settlement with 31 state attorneys general, the   agencies agreed to improve how they fixed mistakes and addressed disputes.   \n",

(Reuters) – Heading into the homestretch of the presidential campaign, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton is looking to harness some celebrity star power to help get out the vote and energize volunteers in battleground states. \\nJennifer Lopez will headline a free concert for Clinton supporters in Miami on Saturday, giving the former secretary of state a chance to connect with the key demographic of millennials she has sometimes struggled to reach – and some visual counter-programming to the latest email controversy to roil her race for the White House. \\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation said on Friday it is investigating more emails as part of a probe into Clinton’s use of a private email system – a late-breaking surprise that will likely continue to get extensive media play leading up to the Nov. 8 vote \\nCelebrity-driven events like the concert “can serve as a bit of a distraction” from the controversy, said Eric Kasper, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire. \\n“It is a way to kind of take the edge off things because it tends to be more positive,” Kasper said. \\nThe JLo concert is the first in a series. Next week, Clinton will take the stage with Jay Z in Cleveland, and then with Katy Perry in Philadelphia on Nov. 5. \\nA Harvard University poll this week showed that among likely voters aged 18 to 29, Clinton is leading Republican rival Donald Trump, a celebrity in his own right who starred in the reality television show “The Apprentice.” \\nBut turnout is a concern. The exceptionally negative tone of this year’s race for the White House has soured young Americans on politics, Reuters/Ipsos polling shows. \\nPresidential candidates have long sought to create buzz with help from celebrity pals, said Tevi Troy, who chronicled the strategy in his book “What Jefferson Read, Ike Watched, and Obama Tweeted: 200 Years of Pop Culture in the White House.” \\n“Campaigns do it to reach out to people who are not necessarily interested in politics but are interested in pop culture,” said Troy, a presidential historian who worked in the George W. Bush White House. \\nThe events are like a larger version of a campaign yard sign, a way to show a “groundswell” of support behind a candidate – and a way to appeal to fans of the musicians, said Kasper, who has studied the intersection between pop culture and politics. \\n“It can create a kind of psychological connection that we otherwise might not have when a politician endorses a presidential candidate, for instance,” Kasper said. \\n(Reporting by Roberta Rampton; Editing by Leslie Adler) \\nConcert plus campaign: Clinton turns to celebrities in homestretch added by Reuters on Sat, Oct 29th, 2016   \n",
